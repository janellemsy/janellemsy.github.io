I analyzed the light from 10,000 galaxies captured by the SDSS telescopes located at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. To do this, I wrote a Python\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/janellemsy/centralflux_sdss/blob/main/foale/centralflux.py\" style = \"color: #0096FF !important\"\u003escript\u003c/a\u003e to retrieve the data and measure the brightness at the center of each galaxy. This central brightness, or central flux emission, provides valuable information about the energy and activity happening at the heart of these celestial objects. By studying this data, we can better understand the fascinating properties and behaviors of galaxies in our universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/optical-example.png\"\nalt=\"Optical Image of a Galaxy in SDSS dataset\"\nstyle=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 35%\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"spectral-lines\"\u003eSpectral Lines\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent chemical elements can emit or absorb specific wavelengths of light. Each element has a unique set of energy levels that its electrons can occupy. When an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it releases energy in the form of light. This emitted light can have specific wavelengths or colors associated with it, forming an element\u0026rsquo;s spectral lines, or emission lines. The ionized gas in galaxies can excite the elements within the galaxy and contributes to its brightness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"visualizing-photoionization-sources-on-the-bpt-diagram\"\u003eVisualizing Photoionization Sources on the BPT Diagram\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many mechanisms, called photoionization sources, that contribute to a galaxy\u0026rsquo;s brightness, or flux emission. The gas in galaxies can be ionized by star-forming regions, active galactic nuclei (AGN: extremely bright compact regions at the center of some galaxies, usually fueld by a supermassive black hole), or by a mix of both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my project, we wanted to determine what photoionization sources are the main culprits for each galaxy\u0026rsquo;s central flux emission. To do this, I visualized my central flux measurements on The Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. It is a scatter plot that helps classify and understand the nature of the ionizing sources in galaxies based on the emission lines observed in their spectra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo construct the BPT diagram for the SDSS dataset, I plotted the intensities of specific emission lines from each galaxy spectrum. The plots I created are shown below. The demarcations on the plot are from \u003ca href =https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605681 style = \"color: #0096FF !important\"\u003eKewley (2006)\u003c/a\u003e and classify the galaxies as star-forming, Seyfert (active), LINERS (Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Region), or composite (contains ionization from both star-formation and AGN). According to the BPT Diagrams, star-forming galaxies tend to have smaller \\( SII/H \\alpha \\), \\(NII/H \\alpha \\), and  \\( OIII/H \\beta \\) ratios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/bpt-panel.png\"\n     alt=\"BPT Diagram\"\n     style=\"float: center; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 90%\" /\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"implementing-a-new-projection-of-the-bpt-space\"\u003eImplementing a New Projection of the BPT Space\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome caveats with the current BPT diagram space is that there have been classification inconsistencies between diagrams based on different line ratios as well as ambiguities in the composite region (the region in between galaxies purely ionized by star formation and the black model grid represents galaxies purely ionized by AGNs). These inconsistencies could lead to biases in the data analysis. Research done by \u003ca href = \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09159\" style = \"color: #0096FF !important\"\u003eXihan (2020)\u003c/a\u003e resulted in a new diagnostic diagram that can overcome the caveats mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of my research at NYU was to implement Xihan\u0026rsquo;s technique to the central flux measurements. The plot I created for the SDSS dataset using Xihan\u0026rsquo;s method is shown below. The cyan model grid represents galaxies purely ionized by star formation and the black model grid represents galaxies purely ionized by AGNs. With this new BPT space, we can clearly see the separation between composite galaxies and the two pure model grids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/reproj.jpg\"\n     alt=\"Reprojected BPT Diagram\"\n     style=\"float: center; margin-bottom: 15px; width:75%\" /\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther research would include computing the fractional AGN contributions for the composite regions, in other words, computing how much of the ionized gas is ionized by an AGN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jupyter notebook that holds the code for this research is found \u003ca href = \"https://github.com/janellemsy/centralflux_sdss/blob/main/foale/3DBPT_Reproj.ipynb\" style = \"color: #0096FF !important\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"Analyzing 10,000 Galaxies for Galaxy Classification","image":null,"permalink":"https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/galaxy-research/","title":"Extragalactic Research"},{"content":"\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/projects/xray-binary-art.jpg\"\n     alt=\"UV Spectrum of NGC 300 X-1\"\n     style=\"float: center; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 55%\" /\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"x-ray-binary-systems\"\u003eX-Ray Binary Systems\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn x-ray binary system is a type of binary star system that emits a significant amount of x-ray radiation.

It is the component of an object\u0026rsquo;s velocity that is directed either towards or away from us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink of it this way: when you observe a moving object, like a car passing by, you can determine its speed and direction. Similarly, in astronomy, astronomers can study the motion of celestial objects by analyzing the changes in the light they emit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen an object moves towards us, the wavelengths of light it emits \u003cem\u003eshortens\u003c/em\u003e, making them appear slightly bluer on the electromagnetic spectrum. This is known as a \u003cem\u003eblueshift\u003c/em\u003e. On the other hand, when an object moves away from us, the wavelengths of light get stretched out, resulting in a slight reddening of the light. This is called a \u003cem\u003eredshift\u003c/em\u003e. You can see these redshifts and blueshifts in the spectrum I plotted below using the data from Hubble.

The radial velocity shift measurement provided crucial insights into the gravitational interaction between the black hole and its companion star which enabled us to recalculate the mass of the black hole within the binary system with greater precision.
